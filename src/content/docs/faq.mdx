In MAS, go to Extras and select the Change Edition option.

#### Will I lose any data in changing the Windows edition from Home to Pro with MAS?
No.

#### I changed my Windows edition from Home to Pro and now Windows is deactivated.
Run HWID activation to activate Pro. Each edition requires separate activation.

#### How to remove HWID, Ohook, KMS38, and Online KMS activation?
[HWID](/docs/hwid#how-to-remove-hwid), [Ohook](/docs/ohook#how-to-remove-ohook), [KMS38](/docs/kms38#how-to-remove-kms38), [Online KMS](/docs/online_kms#how-to-remove-online-kms)

#### Can I link my Microsoft account safely with MAS activation methods?
Yes.

#### Can I update Windows/Office after activation?
Yes.

#### I'm in Russia and Office is not downloading.
Check this [guide](https://gravesoft.dev/bypass-russian-geoblock).

#### Can I activate Office 365?
Yes, use the Ohook activation option. However, you can't get server-side O365-specific features such as 1TB storage in OneDrive, though almost all other features and 5GB storage in a free OneDrive account would work fine.

#### Why Office is showing the "Update License" button in the file menu?
It is appearing even for customers who have a genuine subscription license and there is nothing to worry about. More [info](https://support.microsoft.com/office/update-license-button-29025197-58d9-4b17-acc1-99a45dabf330).

#### Can I get the Copilot feature in Office with MAS activation?
No. [Copilot](https://www.microsoft.com/microsoft-365/microsoft-copilot) is an additional plan that can be added to existing subscriptions of Microsoft 365.

#### Can I get Python in Excel with MAS activation?
[Python in Excel](https://support.microsoft.com/office/introduction-to-python-in-excel-55643c2e-ff56-4168-b1ce-9428c8308545) is currently in the preview and it's a server-side feature. To get this feature, you need to switch the office update channel to the [Insider build](https://github.com/massgravel/Microsoft-Activation-Scripts/discussions/399#discussioncomment-8871527) and then you will be able to get a few tries to test it if you don't have a Microsoft 365 subscription, meaning to get full access, you need a subscription license and it won't work with MAS activation.

#### I'm getting an 'Office is not genuine' banner.
Run Ohook activation from the latest MAS version.

#### Can I delete the MAS folder after activation?
Yes.

#### How is MAS able to activate?
Read activation details in the Docs section.

#### Does MAS work for Windows 7/8.1?
The online KMS option works for Windows 7 Pro & Enterprise (Not Ultimate). All Windows 8/8.1 editions are supported by the Online KMS option.

#### Where can I donate?
MAS project doesn't accept donations and it's free.  
It's because it's a community project and involves many contributors, splitting donations is not practical, and also because profiting from piracy is not good.
